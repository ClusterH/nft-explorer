Visualize ERC721 NFT Collections directly from the blockchain. An alternative to OpenSea/Rarible, etc.

## Features:

- Browse big collections (9,999+ of items) on a single page.
- Navigation on the right side makes easier to find the position within the table and the remaining items on the list.
- Only the data that is visualized is the data that is rendered. (Thanks to https://github.com/bvaughn/react-window !)
- Metadata and image download is also triggered only when the user is visualizing the current items to save bandwidth and improve loading times.
- All the data is cached in localstorage to avoid unnecessary calls to the APIs and blockchain.
- Optional CORS Proxy for full compatibility.
- IPFS Gateway can be selected from a public server list. 

## Options

### CORS Proxy

Not all APIs add the correct CORS Headers to their requests, so an optional CORS Proxy can be used.

Tested with:
- https://github.com/Glifery/cors-proxy
- https://github.com/Rob--W/cors-anywhere

### IPFS Gateway

The Gateway for IPFS can be selected on the options, please refer to https://ipfs.github.io/public-gateway-checker/ for reference on the current status and connection speed.
